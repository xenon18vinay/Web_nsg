Video Input: Video data will be collected from various sources, such as surveillance cameras, body cams or drones already existing The system will be capable of receiving a wide variety of inputs in different formats.
Feature Extraction: Computer vision algorithms will extract relevant features from the video frames, such as objects, patterns or activities.
Model Training: These extracted features will be fed into AI models (often neural networks) that have been trained on large datasets of labelled video data, which will be done based on User requirement.
Analysis and interpretation: The trained AI models will analyse the video in real time or from archived footage, Identifying objects, actions and events.
Output: The system will generate various outputs, such as alerts, reports, heatmaps or raw data, depending on the application and user requirement.
